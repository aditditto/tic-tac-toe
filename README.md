# tic-tac-toe
OOP exercise by making a tic tac toe program on the command line.

A tic-tac-toe game made using Ruby, assignment from The Odin Project.

With this project, I had my first experience with Object Oriented Programming. The project came with its own set of challenges especially practicing the "need to know" philosophy in OOP.
